# Rundeck and MS SQL Server Docker environment

This is a Docker Compose example to run Rundeck + MS SQL Server as backend.

To run just clone the repository and then execute:

`docker compose up`

After a couple of minutes, the Rundeck environmet should be available, open your favorite browser (no IE please!) and access to `http://localhost:4440` URL, user: `admin`, password: `admin`.

You can learn more about Rundeck [here](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/about/introduction.html).

More about MS SQL Server integration [here](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/administration/configuration/database/mssql.html#using-microsoft%C2%AE-sql-server-as-a-database-backend).

Cheers.
